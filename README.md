# Cycling Coach Lab

This is a Go project that uses the [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com) framework for building web applications and the [Templ](https://templ.guide) package for rendering HTML templates.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22.0 or later
- Docker (for building and running the Docker image)
- [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) (for running database migrations)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net) (for loading automatically environment variables from the .env file)

## Setup

1. Make sure the your Go setup is completed:
   Paste the following in your `$HOME/.zshrc`

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
go install go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@latest
make init
```

3. Setup you `.env` file. See [.env.template](.env.template)

## Local Development

To run the server and watch for file changes simultaneously, follow these steps:

1. Open two separate terminal tabs.
2. In the first tab, start the server on port 3000 with the following command:

```sh
make start
```

3. In the second tab, generate the styles.css file by watching for file changes:

```sh
make tailwind
```

## Run App using Docker

1. First, build the Docker image:

```sh
make docker-build
```

2. Then, run the Docker image:

```sh
make docker-run
```

This command will start the server on port 8080.

## Testing

To run the unit tests:

```sh
make test
```

To get test coverage:

```sh
make test-coverage
```

To generate mocks:

```sh
make generate-dev
```

To update snapshots:

```sh
make update-snapshots
```

## K8s development

To test the kubernetes deployment you can install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) on your dev maschine.

1. Install minikube on your maschine
2. Init minikube

```sh
minikube start --vm-driver=docker --alsologtostderr
```

3. Test minikube

```sh
kubectl get pods -A
```
